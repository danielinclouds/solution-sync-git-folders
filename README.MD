To test the solution create folder `dummy` with following structure:
```
dummy
├── folder_a
│   └── file_a
│
├── folder_b
│   
├── script.sh
└── PULLREQUEST.MD
```
Copy `script.sh` and `PULLREQUEST.MD` into `dummy` folder and initialize it as git repository.
After initializing repository add `v1` in file `file_a` and push to git, now you can run `script.sh`.
